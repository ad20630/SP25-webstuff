# WYSIWYG Website Builder Prototype - SP2025
This is a working prototype of the WYSIWYG editor, a drag-and-drop solution to building a website built using Typescript and React. 

## Running the Program
1. From a terminal located inside the main project directory, run `npm install`
2. Type `cd server` and hit enter
3. Run `npm install` again, then run `npm run build`
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Open a new terminal and type `cd client`, then hit enter.
6. Run `npm install` followed by `npm start`

Congrats, you should be running the WYSIWYG Editor prototype! If it hasn't automatically opened in your browser, please open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view.

*If any of the `npm install` instructions give vulnerability errors that can be fixed with `npm audit fix`, please run `npm audit fix`. Do not force fixes if they are breaking (such as by using `npm audit fix --force`), as we cannot guarantee the code will work with forced fixes!*

## Additional Scripts
In addition to `npm run build` and `npm start`, the following scripts are avaliable - but please **do not use them** unless you're sure of what you're doing!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
